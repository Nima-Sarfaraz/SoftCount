# Legacy Streamlit UI

This folder contains the original Streamlit prototype (`Soft_Agar_Colony_Formation_Counter.py`).
It is **not** part of the supported workflow for the public release and is kept only
for historical reference.

If you choose to run it, you will need to install its Streamlit dependencies separately
from the main pinned requirements (see comments in the script for guidance).
